# NM_Student_Performance_Prediction
This project aims to develop a predictive model to classify whether a student will pass their final exam based on various input features, including demographic information, academic history, socioeconomic status, and behavioral factors. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Gradient Boosting to build robust classification models.

End Users:
Students: Benefit from personalized support and interventions tailored to their needs, promoting academic success.

Parents: Gain insights into their child's academic strengths and weaknesses, enabling them to provide targeted support and collaboration with educators.

Educators: Receive insights to intervene proactively and provide tailored support to students, improving overall academic performance.

Policy Makers: Use data-driven insights to develop evidence-based policies and initiatives aimed at improving educational outcomes and addressing systemic barriers.

Community Organizations: Collaborate with schools to provide additional resources and support services tailored to students' needs, fostering a positive learning environment.

Implementation:

Data Preprocessing: Mapping string values to numeric values and feature scaling to prepare the data for modeling.

Model Training: Utilizing machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Gradient Boosting to build classification models.

Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Optimization: Identifying the optimal algorithm through iterations and evaluating its performance.
Actionable Insights: Providing actionable insights based on the model's predictions to support students, parents, educators, and policymakers in promoting student success.

Results:
The optimal algorithm, Logistic Regression, achieved an accuracy of 80.67% and an F1-score of 0.74. The model provides valuable insights into students' academic performance, enabling stakeholders to intervene proactively and support students' success.

Future Enhancements:
Incorporating additional features or data sources to improve the predictive model's accuracy and effectiveness.
Implementing real-time monitoring and feedback mechanisms to adapt interventions based on students' evolving needs.
Collaborating with educational institutions and stakeholders to implement the predictive model and integrate it into existing support systems.
Conducting ongoing evaluation and refinement of the model to ensure its relevance and effectiveness in supporting student success.

Note: The code provided assumes familiarity with Python, machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, and data preprocessing techniques. Before running the code, ensure that the necessary libraries are installed and the dataset (student-data.csv) is available in the specified location.
